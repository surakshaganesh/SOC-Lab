# SOC Analyst Home Lab - Splunk

This repository contains hands-on SOC investigations performed using Splunk Enterprise (Localhost 8000).

## Lab Setup
- Installed Splunk Enterprise locally
- Ingested BOTS dataset
- Ingested DNS, HTTP, SSH, DHCP logs
- Created detection queries
- Performed attack investigation scenarios

## Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise
- Windows/Linux logs
- Network logs (DNS, HTTP, SSH, DHCP)
- Custom Field Extractions

## Objectives
- Practice Tier-1 SOC monitoring
- Detect brute force attacks
- Analyze suspicious HTTP activity
- Investigate DNS anomalies

## Dataset Sources
- Splunk BOTS Dataset (attack simulation data)
- Custom network protocol logs (DNS, HTTP, SSH, DHCP)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Log ingestion
- Field extraction
- DNS traffic analysis
- Statistical aggregation using SPL
- Anomaly detection
- SOC-style investigation reporting

## Projects
- DNS Traffic Anomaly Detection
- SSH Brute Force Detection (Coming Soon)
- HTTP Suspicious Traffic Analysis (Coming Soon)
